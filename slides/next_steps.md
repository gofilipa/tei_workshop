# Want More Practice or Exposure?

Check out these TEI projects that are already done, but cool to explore:
- a "versioning edition" of Virginia Woolf's ["The Mark On The Wall"]()
- Virginia Woolf's [*The Waves*](https://jonreeve.com/projects/waves-tei/waves-tei.xml), marked up by Jonathan Reeve to cohere with CSS.
- [The Letters of Vincent van Gogh](http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters.html)
